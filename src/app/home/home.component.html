    <strong>I'm samo_lego (aka samolego).</strong>
    <p>
        I'm an Android user and slow-uploading YouTuber.
        As you can probably see, I'm a Minecraft fan as well.
        I'm doing all kinds of stuff, mainly interested in technical aspects of the game.
        Not only do I like playing the game, but also coding mods, mainly for Fabric modloader.
        I've made a few datapacks and mods, most of which are open sourced and available on GitHub.
